  abstract = {Because the world's forests play a major role in regulating nutrient and carbon cycles, there is much interest in estimating their biomass. Estimates of aboveground biomass based on well-established methods are relatively abundant; estimates of root biomass based on standard methods are much less common. The goal of this work was to determine if a reliable method to estimate root biomass density for forests could be developed based on existing data from the literature. The forestry literature containing root biomass measurements was reviewed and summarized and relationships between both root biomass density (Mg ha-1) and root:shoot ratios (R/S) as dependent variables and various edaphic and climatic independent variables, singly and in combination, were statistically tested. None of the tested independent variables of aboveground biomass density, latitude, temperature, precipitation, temperature:precipitation ratios, tree type, soil texture, and age had important explanatory value for R/S. However, linear regression analysis showed that aboveground biomass density, age, and latitudinal category were the most important predictors of root biomass density, and together explained 84\% of the variation. A comparison of root biomass density estimates based on our equations with those based on use of generalized R/S ratios for forests in the United States indicated that our method tended to produce estimates that were about 20\% higher.},

  abstract = {The depth at which plants are able to grow roots has important implications for the whole ecosystem hydrological balance, as well as for carbon and nutrient cycling. Here we summarize what we know about the maximum rooting depth of species belonging to the major terrestrial biomes. We found 290 observations of maximum rooting depth in the literature which covered 253 woody and herbaceous species. Maximum rooting depth ranged from 0.3 m for some tundra species to 68 m for Boscia albitrunca in the central Kalahari; 194 species had roots at least 2 m deep, 50 species had roots at a depth of 5 m or more, and 22 species had roots as deep as 10 m or more. The average for the globe was 4.6{$\pm$}0.5 m. Maximum rooting depth by biome was 2.0{$\pm$}0.3 m for boreal forest. 2.1{$\pm$}0.2 m for cropland, 9.5{$\pm$}2.4 m for desert, 5.2{$\pm$}0.8 m for sclerophyllous shrubland and forest, 3.9{$\pm$}0.4 m for temperate coniferous forest, 2.9{$\pm$}0.2 m for temperate deciduous forest, 2.6{$\pm$}0.2 m for temperate grassland, 3.7{$\pm$}0.5 m for tropical deciduous forest, 7.3{$\pm$}2.8 m for tropical evergreen forest, 15.0{$\pm$}5.4 m for tropical grassland/savanna, and 0.5{$\pm$}0.1 m for tundra. Grouping all the species across biomes (except croplands) by three basic functional groups: trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants, the maximum rooting depth was 7.0{$\pm$}1.2 m for trees, 5.1{$\pm$}0.8 m for shrubs, and 2.6{$\pm$}0.1 m for herbaceous plants. These data show that deep root habits are quite common in woody and herbaceous species across most of the terrestrial biomes, far deeper than the traditional view has held up to now. This finding has important implications for a better understanding of ecosystem function and its application in developing ecosystem models.},

``The functional significance of deep roots for water flux in ecosystems under high evaporative conditions has been shown regarding the "hydraulic lift" mechanism which has been reported for several species (Richards and Caldwell 1987; Caldwell and Richards 1989; Dawson 1993). During the night roots take up water from deep soil layers which is released from shallow roots back to the soil in the upper layers. The water is reabsorbed during the next day by the same plants and by shallow-rooted neighbors with no access to deep water.'' (Canadell et al., 1996, p. 587)

``The importance of deep roots for ecosystem nutrient cycling has also been shown for tropical soils with seasonal drought, Cerrado (Schachtschabel et al. 1992). Nitrate salts from mineralization of organic matter cannot be fully utilized by the vegetation early in the rainy season, and so, are washed out of the top soil down to deep soil horizons. There, nitrate is immobilized by the positive charge balance of Fe3+ and A13+ found at depths of 1.6 m or more; deep roots will then have access to this nitrate store later in the growing season.''

  abstract = {In the context of a recent massive increase in research on plant root functions and their impact on the environment, root ecologists currently face many important challenges to keep on generating cutting-edge, meaningful and integrated knowledge. Consideration of the below-ground components in plant and ecosystem studies has been consistently called for in recent decades, but methodology is disparate and sometimes inappropriate. This handbook, based on the collective effort of a large team of experts, will improve trait comparisons across studies and integration of information across databases by providing standardised methods and controlled vocabularies. It is meant to be used not only as starting point by students and scientists who desire working on below-ground ecosystems, but also by experts for consolidating and broadening their views on multiple aspects of root ecology. Beyond the classical compilation of measurement protocols, we have synthesised recommendations from the literature to provide key background knowledge useful for: (1) defining below-ground plant entities and giving keys for their meaningful dissection, classification and naming beyond the classical fine-root vs coarse-root approach; (2) considering the specificity of root research to produce sound laboratory and field data; (3) describing typical, but overlooked steps for studying roots (e.g. root handling, cleaning and storage); and (4) gathering metadata necessary for the interpretation of results and their reuse. Most importantly, all root traits have been introduced with some degree of ecological context that will be a foundation for understanding their ecological meaning, their typical use and uncertainties, and some methodological and conceptual perspectives for future research. Considering all of this, we urge readers not to solely extract protocol recommendations for trait measurements from this work, but to take a moment to read and reflect on the extensive information contained in this broader guide to root ecology, including sections I\textendash VII and the many introductions to each section and root trait description. Finally, it is critical to understand that a major aim of this guide is to help break down barriers between the many subdisciplines of root ecology and ecophysiology, broaden researchers' views on the multiple aspects of root study and create favourable conditions for the inception of comprehensive experiments on the role of roots in plant and ecosystem functioning.},

  abstract = {Understanding and predicting ecosystem functioning (e.g., carbon and water fluxes) and the role of soils in carbon storage requires an accurate assessment of plant rooting distributions. Here, in a comprehensive literature synthesis, we analyze rooting patterns for terrestrial biomes and compare distributions for various plant functional groups. We compiled a database of 250 root studies, subdividing suitable results into 11 biomes, and fitted the depth coefficient {$\beta$} to the data for each biome (Gale and Grigal 1987). {$\beta$} is a simple numerical index of rooting distribution based on the asymptotic equation Y=1-{$\beta$}d, where d = depth and Y = the proportion of roots from the surface to depth d. High values of {$\beta$} correspond to a greater proportion of roots with depth. Tundra, boreal forest, and temperate grasslands showed the shallowest rooting profiles ({$\beta$}=0.913, 0.943, and 0.943, respectively), with 80-90\% of roots in the top 30 cm of soil; deserts and temperate coniferous forests showed the deepest profiles ({$\beta$}=0.975 and 0.976, respectively) and had only 50\% of their roots in the upper 30 cm. Standing root biomass varied by over an order of magnitude across biomes, from approximately 0.2 to 5 kg m-2. Tropical evergreen forests had the highest root biomass (5 kg m-2), but other forest biomes and sclerophyllous shrublands were of similar magnitude. Root biomass for croplands, deserts, tundra and grasslands was below 1.5 kg m-2. Root/shoot (R/S) ratios were highest for tundra, grasslands, and cold deserts (ranging from 4 to 7); forest ecosystems and croplands had the lowest R/S ratios (approximately 0.1 to 0.5). Comparing data across biomes for plant functional groups, grasses had 44\% of their roots in the top 10 cm of soil. ({$\beta$}=0.952), while shrubs had only 21\% in the same depth increment ({$\beta$}=0.978). The rooting distribution of all temperate and tropical trees was {$\beta$}=0.970 with 26\% of roots in the top 10 cm and 60\% in the top 30 cm. Overall, the globally averaged root distribution for all ecosystems was {$\beta$}=0.966 (r 2=0.89) with approximately 30\%, 50\%, and 75\% of roots in the top 10 cm, 20 cm, and 40 cm, respectively. We discuss the merits and possible shortcomings of our analysis in the context of root biomass and root functioning.},

Cuttings were grown for 10 weeks in layered sediment types in five large planter boxes, each box having three separate compartments. The boxes differed in the proportion of silt, sand and stones. At 10 weeks, the roots were extracted and sorted into diameter classes ({$\geq$}2 mm; 1 {$<$} 2 mm; {$<$}1 mm) according to sediment type and depth. Root length and dry mass were measured and root length density (RLD) and root mass density (RMD) calculated. Root development of S. nigra cuttings varied with the substrate, either silt, sand or stones. Roots initiated from the entire length of the cutting in the substrate but with a concentration of initials located at the bottom and close to the bottom of the cutting. There was substantial root extension into all three substrates and at all depths. Generally, RMD was higher in the stones, influenced by having the bottom of the cuttings in stones for four of the five treatments. RMD was highest for roots {$<$}1 mm diameter. RMD of roots {$<$}1 mm diameter was least for those roots growing in sand. Whereas RLD for roots {$>$}0.5 mm diameter was highest in the sand, RLD of roots with diameter {$<$}0.5 mm was lowest in sand. Roots of S. nigra cuttings were least effective in binding sand, primarily because of low RLD of roots {$<$}0.5 mm diameter. It is surmised that sand lacks water and nutrients sufficient to sustain growth of fine roots compared with silt and even stones. RLD for roots {$>$}0.5 mm diameter was lowest in silt likely due to the greater resistance of the substrate to root penetration, or possibly the greater investment into smaller roots with absorption capability.},

We used canonical correlation analysis to cross directly the occurrenceby-species table of 4 992 individuals (d.b.h. 10 cm) belonging to 120 species with qualitative soil variables and quantitative spatial data. Firstly, the list of species occurrences was confronted to nine soil descriptors characterising a weathering sequence from the initial well-drained ferralitic cover to transformed hydromorphic soil conditions. This analysis revealed that, apart from some specialised species restricted to the swamps that experience prolonged water saturation, the most abundant species can be ordered along two intermingled gradients of tolerance limiting their niche amplitude: a main gradient of tolerance to prolonged water saturation that appears down slope during the weathering sequence; a second gradient of less importance, displaying the species intolerant of prolonged water saturation according to their tolerance to temporary confinement of the uphill transformed soil systems due to the late appearance of a perched water-table. The results support the hypothesis that at Piste de St Elie, the constraining soil conditions imposed by surface water saturation are more important determinants for tree zonation of many tree species than water shortage. Secondly, the list of species occurrences was confronted to a spatial data table built from a trend surface regression of the tree coordinates. This analysis indicated that soil drainage is the main structuring factor of the local multispecies spatial pattern. After partialling out the soil effect, the multispecies pattern revealed a broader scale of heterogeneity that we supposed to be linked to endogenous factors resulting from population dynamics. Implications of the results are then discussed in the perspective of future research on tree zonation, local diversity pattern and community structuring in tropical rainforests.},

  abstract = {Studies in global plant biogeography have almost exclusively analyzed relationships of abiotic and biotic factors with the distribution and structure of vegetation aboveground. The goal of this study was to extend such analyses to the belowground structure of vegetation by determining the biotic and abiotic factors that influence vertical root distributions in the soil, including soil, climate, and plant properties. The analysis used a database of vertical root profiles from the literature with 475 profiles from 209 geographic locations. Since most profiles were not sampled to the maximum rooting depth, several techniques were used to estimate the amount of roots at greater depths, to a maximum of 3 m in some systems. The accuracy of extrapolations was tested using a subset of deeply ({$>$}2 m) sampled or completely sampled profiles. Vertical root distributions for each profile were characterized by the interpolated 50\% and 95\% rooting depths (the depths above which 50\% or 95\% of all roots were located). General linear models incorporating plant life-form dominance, climate, and soil variables explained as much as 50\% of the variance in rooting depths for various biomes and life-forms. Annual potential evapotranspiration (PET) and precipitation together accounted for the largest proportion of the variance (12\textendash 16\% globally and 38\% in some systems). Mean 95\% rooting depths increased with decreasing latitude from 80\textdegree{} to 30\textdegree{} but showed no clear trend in the tropics. Annual PET, annual precipitation, and length of the warm season were all positively correlated with rooting depths. Rooting depths in tropical vegetation were only weakly correlated with climatic variables but were strongly correlated with sampling depths, suggesting that even after extrapolation, sampling depths there were often insufficient to characterize root profiles. Globally, {$>$}90\% of all profiles had at least 50\% of all roots in the upper 0.3 m of the soil profile (including organic horizons) and 95\% of all roots in the upper 2 m. Deeper rooting depths were mainly found in water-limited ecosystems. Deeper 95\% rooting depths were also found for shrublands compared to grasslands, in sandy soils vs. clay or loam soils, and in systems with relatively shallow organic horizons compared with deeper organic horizons.},

  abstract = {We observed strong positive relationships between soil properties and forest dynamics of growth and mortality across twelve primary lowland tropical forests in a phosphorus-poor region of the Guiana Shield. Average tree growth (diameter at breast height) increased from 0.81 to 2.1\,mm\,yr-1 along a soil texture gradient from 0 to 67\% clay, and increasing metal-oxide content. Soil organic carbon stocks in the top 30\,cm ranged from 30 to 118 tons C ha-1, phosphorus content ranged from 7 to 600\,mg\,kg-1 soil, and the relative abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi ranged from 0 to 50\%, all positively correlating with soil clay, and iron and aluminum oxide and hydroxide content. In contrast, already low extractable phosphorus (Bray P) content decreased from 4.4 to {$<$}0.02\,mg\,kg-1 in soil with increasing clay content. A greater prevalence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in more clayey forests that had higher tree growth and mortality, but not biomass, indicates that despite the greater investment in nutrient uptake required, soils with higher clay content may actually serve to sustain high tree growth in tropical forests by avoiding phosphorus losses from the ecosystem. Our study demonstrates how variation in soil properties that retain carbon and nutrients can help to explain variation in tropical forest growth and mortality, but not biomass, by requiring niche specialization and contributing to biogeochemical diversification across this region.},
