  abstract = {Both habitat filtering and dispersal limitation influence the compositional structure of forest communities, but previous studies examining the relative contributions of these processes with variation partitioning have primarily used topography to represent the influence of the environment. Here, we bring together data on both topography and soil resource variation within eight large (24{\textendash}50 ha) tropical forest plots, and use variation partitioning to decompose community compositional variation into fractions explained by spatial, soil resource and topographic variables. Both soil resources and topography account for significant and approximately equal variation in tree community composition (9{\textendash}34\% and 5{\textendash}29\%, respectively), and all environmental variables together explain 13{\textendash}39\% of compositional variation within a plot. A large fraction of variation (19{\textendash}37\%) was spatially structured, yet unexplained by the environment, suggesting an important role for dispersal processes and unmeasured environmental variables. For the majority of sites, adding soil resource variables to topography nearly doubled the inferred role of habitat filtering, accounting for variation in compositional structure that would previously have been attributable to dispersal. Our results, illustrated using a new graphical depiction of community structure within these plots, demonstrate the importance of small-scale environmental variation in shaping local community structure in diverse tropical forests around the globe.},

Estimates of aboveground biomass based on well-established methods are relatively abundant; estimates of root biomass based on standard methods are much less common. The goal of this work was to determine if a reliable method to estimate root biomass density for forests could be developed based on existing data from the literature. The forestry literature containing root biomass measurements was reviewed and summarized and relationships between both root biomass density (Mg ha-1) and root:shoot ratios (R/S) as dependent variables and various edaphic and climatic independent variables, singly and in combination, were statistically tested. None of the tested independent variables of aboveground biomass density, latitude, temperature, precipitation, temperature:precipitation ratios, tree type, soil texture, and age had important explanatory value for R/S. However, linear regression analysis showed that aboveground biomass density, age, and latitudinal category were the most important predictors of root biomass density, and together explained 84\% of the variation. A comparison of root biomass density estimates based on our equations with those based on use of generalized R/S ratios for forests in the United States indicated that our method tended to produce estimates that were about 20\% higher.},

Here we summarize what we know about the maximum rooting depth of species belonging to the major terrestrial biomes. We found 290 observations of maximum rooting depth in the literature which covered 253 woody and herbaceous species. Maximum rooting depth ranged from 0.3 m for some tundra species to 68 m for Boscia albitrunca in the central Kalahari; 194 species had roots at least 2 m deep, 50 species had roots at a depth of 5 m or more, and 22 species had roots as deep as 10 m or more. The average for the globe was 4.6{$\pm$}0.5 m. Maximum rooting depth by biome was 2.0{$\pm$}0.3 m for boreal forest. 2.1{$\pm$}0.2 m for cropland, 9.5{$\pm$}2.4 m for desert, 5.2{$\pm$}0.8 m for sclerophyllous shrubland and forest, 3.9{$\pm$}0.4 m for temperate coniferous forest, 2.9{$\pm$}0.2 m for temperate deciduous forest, 2.6{$\pm$}0.2 m for temperate grassland, 3.7{$\pm$}0.5 m for tropical deciduous forest, 7.3{$\pm$}2.8 m for tropical evergreen forest, 15.0{$\pm$}5.4 m for tropical grassland/savanna, and 0.5{$\pm$}0.1 m for tundra. Grouping all the species across biomes (except croplands) by three basic functional groups: trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants, the maximum rooting depth was 7.0{$\pm$}1.2 m for trees, 5.1{$\pm$}0.8 m for shrubs, and 2.6{$\pm$}0.1 m for herbaceous plants. These data show that deep root habits are quite common in woody and herbaceous species across most of the terrestrial biomes, far deeper than the traditional view has held up to now. This finding has important implications for a better understanding of ecosystem function and its application in developing ecosystem models.},

``The importance of deep roots for ecosystem nutrient cycling has also been shown for tropical soils with seasonal drought, Cerrado (Schachtschabel et al. 1992). Nitrate salts from mineralization of organic matter cannot be fully utilized by the vegetation early in the rainy season, and so, are washed out of the top soil down to deep soil horizons. There, nitrate is immobilized by the positive charge balance of Fe3+ and A13+ found at depths of 1.6 m or more; deep roots will then have access to this nitrate store later in the growing season.''

  abstract = {Biomass content and turnover rate were estimated for a lowland wet rain forest in French Guiana. A  regression model relating the biomass of a tree to its dbh (diameter at breast height) was deduced from previously  published data. A power-law allometric relationship of the form AGTB = aDb was used to estimate the tree biomass,  AGTB (Mg ha-1), from its dbh D (cm). Using direct measurements of tree biomass in the literature, the best-fit  allometric exponent b = 2.42 (SD = 0.02) was found. The logarithm of the coefficient a was normally distributed with  an average of -2.00 (SD = 0.27). This method was applied to two permanent research stations of the lowland tropical  rain forest of French Guiana: the Nouragues and Piste de Saint-Elie. At the Nouragues, the biomass was estimated  from trees 10 cm in diameter on two plots covering a total surface area of 22 ha and yielded an average biomass of  309 Mg ha-1 ({$\pm$} 32 Mg ha-1, 95\% confidence interval). Spatial variability was also addressed at the Nouragues by  estimating the biomass of trees {$\geq$} 30 cm dbh over a total surface area of 82 ha. For the wet tropical forest vegetation  type, an average of 284 Mg ha-1 was obtained (spatial variability {$\pm$}55 Mg ha-1). Biomass turnover was evaluated  at Piste de Saint-Elie from two transects (0.78 and 1 ha) on which all trees {$\geq$}5 cm in diameter were recorded and  mapped twice in 10 y. Transect 1 showed a slight increase in biomass, from 245 to 260 Mg ha-1 (338 to 345 Mg  ha-1 for transect 2), corresponding to a net increase of 1.9 Mg ha-1 y-1 (0.7 Mg ha-1 y-1), and the biomass ingrowth  was 3.2 Mg ha-1 y-1 (2.8 Mg ha-1 y-1).

  abstract = {Tropical rain forests have the highest tree diversity on earth. Nonrandom spatial distributions of these species in relation to edaphic factors could be one mechanism responsible for maintaining this diversity. We examined the prevalence of nonrandom distributions of trees and palms in relation to soil type and topographic position (``edaphic biases'') over a mesoscale (573 ha) old-growth tropical rain forest (TRF) landscape at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. All trees and palms {$\geq$}10 cm diameter were measured and identified in 1170 circular 0.01-ha plots centered on an existing 50 {\texttimes} 100 m grid. Topographic position was classified for each plot, and slope and aspect were measured. Soil type data were taken from a previous study (Clark et al. 1998). A total of 5127 trees and palms were identified in 267 species. Detrended Correspondence Analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis showed that highly significant edaphic gradients were present, with swamp or highly fertile soils separated from the less fertile, well-drained upland soils. Species composition remained significantly related to topographic position when soil type was controlled for. The main floristic gradients were still significant when flooded sites were excluded from the analyses. Randomization tests on a weighted preference index were used to examine the relations of individual species to soil types and, within the dominant soil type, to topographic position. Of the 132 species with N {$\geq$} 5 individuals, 33 showed significant associations with soil type. Within the dominant soil type, 13 of 110 analyzable species were nonrandomly associated with one or more topographic positions. For a variety of reasons, including issues relating to sample size and adequate edaphic characterization of landscapes, we suggest that the {$\sim$}30\% of species shown to be edaphically biased in this study is an underestimate of the true degree of edaphically related distributional biases. To evaluate this hypothesis will require mesoscale vegetation sampling combined with quantitative soil analyses at the same scale in a range of tropical rain forests. If edaphic distributional biases are shown to be common, this suggests that edaphically linked processes leading to differential recruitment are similarly common.},

Five profiles were opened for the morphological description of the soil horizons, and hydro-physical and micromorphological analyses were performed to characterize the soil. Arenic Haplustult, Arenic Haplustalf and Aquertic Haplustalf were the soil types observed in the plot. The superficial horizons had lower density and greater hydraulic conductivity, porosity and water retention in lower tensions than the deeper horizons. In the sub-superficial horizons, greater water retention at higher tensions and lower hydraulic conductivity were observed, due to structure type and greater clay content. The differences observed in the water retention curves between the sandy E and the clay B horizons were mainly due to the size distribution, shape and type of soil pores.},

Humans have begun to drastically alter the prevalence of these environmental factors with untold consequences for plant communities and ecosystems worldwide. Given limitations in using organ-level traits to predict ecological performance of species, recent advances using tolerances of low resource availability as plant functional traits are revealing the often hidden roles these factors have in structuring communities and are becoming central to classifying plants ecologically. For example, measuring the physiological drought tolerance of plants has increased the predictability of differences among species in their ability to survive drought as well as the distribution of species within and among ecosystems. Quantifying the shade tolerance of species has improved our understanding of local and regional species diversity and how species have sorted within and among regions. As the stresses on ecosystems continue to shift, coordinated studies of whole-plant growth centered on tolerance of low resource availability will be central in predicting future ecosystem functioning and biodiversity. This will require efforts that quantify tolerances for large numbers of species and develop bioinformatic and other techniques for comparing large number of species.},

There was seasonality in leaf fall and total litterfall in mixed forest and tall Amazon Caatinga forest but no definite trend in the Bana. Litterfall curves were significantly correlated among sites indicating common regulating factors in the three forests. Leaf litter from mixed forest on Tierra Firme was richer in N with extremely low Ca and Mg concentrations; tall Amazon Caatinga litter had higher P and Mg concentration, while Bana litter was low in N but K concentration was twice as high as in the other two forests. Annual fine litterfall in Tierra Firme mixed forest was nearly 4 times higher than in Bana, But N flux was 10 times higher, while Ca and Mg fluxes were similar. Tall Amazon Caatinga had Ca and Mg fluxes in litterfall 2{\textendash}3 times higher than the other two forests. Within-stand efficiency of nitrogen, calcium and magnesium use, as measured by biomass/nutrient ratios, differentiates Tierra Firme from Caatinga and Bana forest: Tierra Firme has the lowest N, but the highest Ca and Mg use efficiencies. Higher P use efficiency was measured in Bana followed by Tierra Firme and Caatinga; while Tierra Firme and Caatinga showed similar higher K use efficiencies than Bana. N/P ratios indicates that Tierra Firme forest is limited by P availability, while low N availability predominates in Caatinga. Bana appears limited by both N and P. These differences probably relate to variations in degree of sclerophylly and leaf duration which determine leaf nutrient concentrations in the ecosystems studied.},

Much of this SOC is in subsoil, yet variation in the distribution of SOC through the soil profile remains poorly characterized across tropical forests. We used a correlative approach to quantify relationships among depth distributions of SOC, fine root biomass, nutrients and texture to 1~m depths across 43 lowland tropical forests in Panama. The sites span rainfall and soil fertility gradients, and these are largely uncorrelated for these sites. We used fitted {$\beta$} parameters to characterize depth distributions, where {$\beta$} is a numerical index based on an asymptotic relationship, such that larger {$\beta$} values indicate greater concentrations of root biomass or SOC at depth in the profile. Root {$\beta$} values ranged from 0.82 to 0.95 and were best predicted by soil pH and extractable potassium (K) stocks. For example, the three most acidic (pH\,{$<$}\,4) and K-poor ({$<$}\,20~g~K~m-2) soils contained 76\,{$\pm$}\,5\% of fine root biomass from 0 to 10~cm depth, while the three least acidic (pH\,{$>$}\,6.0) and most K-rich ({$>$}\,50~g~K~m-2) soils contained only 41\,{$\pm$}\,9\% of fine root biomass at this depth. Root {$\beta$} and SOC {$\beta$} values were inversely related, such that a large fine root biomass in surface soils corresponded to large SOC stocks in subsoils (50{\textendash}100~cm). SOC {$\beta$} values were best predicted by soil pH and base cation stocks, with the three most base-poor soils containing 34\,{$\pm$}\,8\% of SOC from 50 to 100~cm depth, and the three most base-rich soils containing just 9\,{$\pm$}\,2\% of SOC at this depth. Nutrient depth distributions were not related to Root {$\beta$} or SOC {$\beta$} values. These data show that large surface root biomass stocks are associated with large subsoil C stocks in strongly weathered tropical soils. Further studies are required to evaluate why this occurs, and whether changes in surface root biomass, as may occur with global change, could in turn influence SOC storage in tropical forest subsoils.},

  abstract = {1 We examined the effects of variation in gap size on above- and below-ground light and nutrient processes in a tropical wet forest in Costa Rica. 2 Trees were felled to create canopy openings ranging in size from 65 to 611 m2. Following treefall, we measured initial litter mass in the crown zone of six gaps. During the subsequent year, we measured litter decomposition rate and light levels as well as NH4-N, NO3-N and PO4-P levels in surface soils, soil moisture and fine root mass. We also measured growth rates of fertilized and non-fertilized plants of four species of Miconia (Melastomataceae) to assess nutrient limitation to plant growth in large gaps. 3 Light levels in the centres of gaps were significantly related to size of the canopy opening. After 1 year, light levels near the ground in larger openings (35{\textendash}40\% full sunlight immediately after treefall) declined to levels similar to those in smaller gaps (10{\textendash}20\%). 4 Although canopy opening had only slight effects on soil NH4-N, NO3-N pools were significantly greater in gaps than in understorey at both sites. The effect was positively correlated with gap size. Extractable PO4-P was also greater in gaps than in adjacent understorey, although the difference did not vary as a function of gap size. In three of six gaps, fine root biomass was less in gaps than in adjacent understorey. 5 Of four species of Miconia, only M. affinis, a small tree common in early secondary forests, grew significantly faster in fertilized than in non-fertilized treatments in three large gaps. 6 Our data suggest that higher nutrient pools in surface soils of treefall gaps may result from decomposition and mineralization of the large mass of fresh litter from the fallen tree. While growth rates of shade-tolerant rain forest trees and shrubs are not much affected by the increased nutrient availability even at high light levels, growth rates of pioneer or high-light demanding species may be enhanced by increased above- and below-ground resources.},

The soil of 30 plots along six transects was characterized. The appearance of the `dry to the touch' character at a depth of less than 1.2 m was used to discriminate soils exhibiting vertical drainage from soils exhibiting superficial lateral drainage and along with colour and texture, to define five classes from well-drained to strongly hydromorphic soils. Spatial variation in soil respiration was closely related to topographic position and soil type. Increasing soil water content and bulk density and decreasing root biomass and soil carbon content explained most of the decrease in soil respiration from the plateaux (vertically drained hypoferralic acrisol) to the bottomlands (haplic gleysol). These results will help to stratify further field experiments and to identify the underlying determinants of spatial variation in soil respiration to develop mechanistic models of soil respiration.},

Earth system models are highly sensitive to this particular parameter with large consequences for modeled plant productivity, water{\textendash}energy{\textendash}carbon exchange between the land and the atmosphere, and silicate weathering regulating multimillion-year-timescale carbon cycle. However, we know little about how deep roots go and why. Accidental discoveries of {$>$}70-m-deep roots in wells and {$>$}20-m-deep roots in caves offer glimpses of the enormous plasticity of root response to its environment, but the drivers and the global significance of such deep roots are not clear. Through observations and modeling, we demonstrate that soil hydrology is a globally prevalent force driving landscape to global patterns of plant rooting depth.           ,              Plant rooting depth affects ecosystem resilience to environmental stress such as drought. Deep roots connect deep soil/groundwater to the atmosphere, thus influencing the hydrologic cycle and climate. Deep roots enhance bedrock weathering, thus regulating the long-term carbon cycle. However, we know little about how deep roots go and why. Here, we present a global synthesis of 2,200 root observations of {$>$}1,000 species along biotic (life form, genus) and abiotic (precipitation, soil, drainage) gradients. Results reveal strong sensitivities of rooting depth to local soil water profiles determined by precipitation infiltration depth from the top (reflecting climate and soil), and groundwater table depth from below (reflecting topography-driven land drainage). In well-drained uplands, rooting depth follows infiltration depth; in waterlogged lowlands, roots stay shallow, avoiding oxygen stress below the water table; in between, high productivity and drought can send roots many meters down to the groundwater capillary fringe. This framework explains the contrasting rooting depths observed under the same climate for the same species but at distinct topographic positions. We assess the global significance of these hydrologic mechanisms by estimating root water-uptake depths using an inverse model, based on observed productivity and atmosphere, at 30{${''}$} ({$\sim$}1-km) global grids to capture the topography critical to soil hydrology. The resulting patterns of plant rooting depth bear a strong topographic and hydrologic signature at landscape to global scales. They underscore a fundamental plant{\textendash}water feedback pathway that may be critical to understanding plant-mediated global change.},

  abstract = {In the context of a recent massive increase in research on plant root functions and their impact on the environment, root ecologists currently face many important challenges to keep on generating cutting-edge, meaningful and integrated knowledge. Consideration of the below-ground components in plant and ecosystem studies has been consistently called for in recent decades, but methodology is disparate and sometimes inappropriate. This handbook, based on the collective effort of a large team of experts, will improve trait comparisons across studies and integration of information across databases by providing standardised methods and controlled vocabularies. It is meant to be used not only as starting point by students and scientists who desire working on below-ground ecosystems, but also by experts for consolidating and broadening their views on multiple aspects of root ecology. Beyond the classical compilation of measurement protocols, we have synthesised recommendations from the literature to provide key background knowledge useful for: (1) defining below-ground plant entities and giving keys for their meaningful dissection, classification and naming beyond the classical fine-root vs coarse-root approach; (2) considering the specificity of root research to produce sound laboratory and field data; (3) describing typical, but overlooked steps for studying roots (e.g. root handling, cleaning and storage); and (4) gathering metadata necessary for the interpretation of results and their reuse. Most importantly, all root traits have been introduced with some degree of ecological context that will be a foundation for understanding their ecological meaning, their typical use and uncertainties, and some methodological and conceptual perspectives for future research. Considering all of this, we urge readers not to solely extract protocol recommendations for trait measurements from this work, but to take a moment to read and reflect on the extensive information contained in this broader guide to root ecology, including sections I{\textendash}VII and the many introductions to each section and root trait description. Finally, it is critical to understand that a major aim of this guide is to help break down barriers between the many subdisciplines of root ecology and ecophysiology, broaden researchers' views on the multiple aspects of root study and create favourable conditions for the inception of comprehensive experiments on the role of roots in plant and ecosystem functioning.},

The main limitation is that the pool of roots {$\leq$} 2 mm includes several root orders (generally between two and five or more) that differ in structure and function (McCormack et al., 2015a)'' (Freschet et al., 2021, p. 985)},

  abstract = {Changes in soil physical conditions can have an impact on plant root growth. However, the underlying functional responses of root growth to variations in soil physical properties still remain poorly understood. We assessed the responses of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) roots to a typical range of soil physical properties created by applying different degrees of loosening or compaction to subsurface soil layers. A replicated field experiment was established on a Templeton silt loam soil (Dystric Ustochrept) in Canterbury, New Zealand. Following removal of the top 15 cm of soil, five mechanical treatments were applied: loosened by cultivation, three degrees of compaction using a roller (one pass, eight passes, and eight passes with vibration), and an untreated control. Subsequently, the top 15 cm of soil was repositioned. The impact of these treatments on soil physical properties in the subsurface soil layer (15{\textendash}30 cm) produced a discernible gradient that was well characterized by shifts in pore-size distribution, in particular macroporosity (radii {$>$} 30 {$\mu$}m). Macroporosity values were well represented throughout the range from 0.035 up to 0.20 m3 m-3 (n = 50), and these values were negatively correlated with both penetration resistance and bulk density measurements (r {$\leq$} -0.80; P {$<$} 0.001). We found clear responses of root growth to this established gradient. As macroporosity decreased, root diameter increased by 42\% (r = -0.63), while root length density decreased by 65\% (r = +0.66). However, these divergent responses of root diameter and length density to changes in macroporosity were not linear over the whole range but exhibited specific response thresholds. The thresholds of macroporosity, where root responses inflected and became particularly pronounced, were {$<$}0.077 m3 m-3 for root diameter and {$>$}0.12 m3 m-3 for root length density, suggesting that macroporosity values above 0.13 m3 m-3 can facilitate root growth. Although these belowground responses were clearly evident, we detected no effects of these varying conditions on aboveground plant productivity. Moreover, the results also indicate that moderate-to-high soil water contents during the early stages of plant development allow annual roots to overcome potentially restricting soil physical conditions.},

The modular structure of roots enables them to respond to their environment, and roots are very adaptive at modifying growth throughout the root system to concentrate their efforts in the areas that are the most profitable. Roots also form associations with microorganisms as a strategy to enhance resource capture. However, while the responses of roots in nutrient patches are well-recognized, overall `rules of response' and variation in strategy among plant species that can be applied in a number of different environments are still lacking. Finally, there is increasing evidence that root{\textendash}root interactions are much more sophisticated than previously thought, and the evidence for roots to identify self from non-self roots will be briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {Several recent studies demonstrate that yield of individual plants, and their allocation of biomass between roots and shoots, can be profoundly affected by the pattern of supply of soil-based resources. Patchy provision of soil-based resources can affect the location of root biomass, as roots often proliferate in nutrient-rich patches. Root system size is important in determining whether plants access nutrient-rich patches, and the proportion of root systems located within such patches. This proportion will alter as growth proceeds. Species with small root systems have a limited ability to place roots in nutrientrich patches even when they are very close. Of four species with different root system sizes, the growth of the species with the smallest root system was significantly limited by being located in nutrient-poor substrate even when nutrient-rich substrate was only 3.5 cm away, whereas three species with larger root systems were not disadvantaged. Both in the laboratory and in the field, root density is higher in nutrient-rich patches, and such patches can contain roots of many plants. Recent work showing that plants can respond to nonself roots sharing the same nutrient supply suggests that competition will be more severe in nutritionally patchy substrates than in homogeneous environments with the same overall nutrient supply. Taken together, these facts lead to the prediction that inter- and intraspecific plant interactions will be influenced by patterns of nutrient supply. We present evidence supporting this prediction, and indicating that population and community structure are also affected by patterns of nutrient supply. Significant differences in population yield, plant size distribution, and mortality have been recorded between populations growing under patchy and uniform conditions. Plant communities grown from identical seed inocula, with the same overall nutrient supply, provided in different spatial and temporal patterns, differed by up to 44\% in total biomass, up to 70\% in root biomass, and differed in species composition. These significant effects of heterogeneous resource supply on plants merit further detailed study.},

A 52-ha permanent plot was divided into 1300 quadrats measuring 20\,m\,{\texttimes}\,20\,m; for each Dryobalanops species, the number and total basal area of trees {$\geq$}1\,cm in d.b.h. were compared among groups of quadrats with different site conditions. Because spatial distributions of both Dryobalanops and site-condition variables were aggregated, Monte-Carlo permutation tests were applied to analyze the relationships. Both single and multifactor statistical tests showed that the density and basal area distributions of the two species were significantly non-random in relation to soil texture and topographic variables. D.\,aromatica was significantly more abundant at higher elevations, in sandy soils, and on convex and steep slopes. In contrast, D.\,lanceolata preferred lower elevations and less sandy soils. In the study plot, there were very few sites (3 of 1150 quadrats tested) where the models of Hayashi's method predicted the co-occurrence of the two species. These results suggest that between-species differences in habitat preferences are so large that they alone explain the spatially segregated distributions of these two species within the 52-ha study plot.},

  abstract = {The extent and consequences of global land-cover and land-use change are increasingly apparent. One consequence not so apparent is the altered structure of plants belowground. This paper examines such belowground changes, emphasizing the interaction of altered root distributions with other factors and their treatment in models. Shifts of woody and herbaceous vegetation with deforestation, afforestation, and woody plant encroachment typically alter the depth and distribution of plant roots, influencing soil nutrients, the water balance, and net primary productivity (NPP). For example, our analysis of global soil data sets shows that the major plant nutrients C, N, P, and K are more shallowly distributed than are Ca, Mg, and Na, but patterns for each element vary with the dominant vegetation type. After controlling for climate, soil C and N are distributed more deeply in arid shrublands than in arid grasslands, and subhumid forests have shallower nutrient distributions than do subhumid grasslands. Consequently, changes in vegetation may influence the distribution of soil carbon and nutrients over time (perhaps decades to centuries). Shifts in the water balance are typically much more rapid. Catchment studies indicate that the water yield decreases 25{\textendash}40 mm for each 10\% increase in tree cover, and increases in transpiration of water taken up by deep roots may account for as much as 50\% of observed responses. Because models are increasingly important for predicting the consequences of vegetation change, we discuss the treatment of belowground processes and how different treatments affect model outputs. Whether models are parameterized by biome or plant life form (or neither), use single or multiple soil layers, or include N and water limitation will all affect predicted outcomes. Acknowledging and understanding such differences should help constrain predictions of vegetation change.},

  abstract = {Understanding and predicting ecosystem functioning (e.g., carbon and water fluxes) and the role of soils in carbon storage requires an accurate assessment of plant rooting distributions. Here, in a comprehensive literature synthesis, we analyze rooting patterns for terrestrial biomes and compare distributions for various plant functional groups. We compiled a database of 250 root studies, subdividing suitable results into 11 biomes, and fitted the depth coefficient {$\beta$} to the data for each biome (Gale and Grigal 1987). {$\beta$} is a simple numerical index of rooting distribution based on the asymptotic equation Y=1-{$\beta$}d, where d = depth and Y = the proportion of roots from the surface to depth d. High values of {$\beta$} correspond to a greater proportion of roots with depth. Tundra, boreal forest, and temperate grasslands showed the shallowest rooting profiles ({$\beta$}=0.913, 0.943, and 0.943, respectively), with 80-90\% of roots in the top 30 cm of soil; deserts and temperate coniferous forests showed the deepest profiles ({$\beta$}=0.975 and 0.976, respectively) and had only 50\% of their roots in the upper 30 cm. Standing root biomass varied by over an order of magnitude across biomes, from approximately 0.2 to 5 kg m-2. Tropical evergreen forests had the highest root biomass (5 kg m-2), but other forest biomes and sclerophyllous shrublands were of similar magnitude. Root biomass for croplands, deserts, tundra and grasslands was below 1.5 kg m-2. Root/shoot (R/S) ratios were highest for tundra, grasslands, and cold deserts (ranging from 4 to 7); forest ecosystems and croplands had the lowest R/S ratios (approximately 0.1 to 0.5). Comparing data across biomes for plant functional groups, grasses had 44\% of their roots in the top 10 cm of soil. ({$\beta$}=0.952), while shrubs had only 21\% in the same depth increment ({$\beta$}=0.978). The rooting distribution of all temperate and tropical trees was {$\beta$}=0.970 with 26\% of roots in the top 10 cm and 60\% in the top 30 cm. Overall, the globally averaged root distribution for all ecosystems was {$\beta$}=0.966 (r 2=0.89) with approximately 30\%, 50\%, and 75\% of roots in the top 10 cm, 20 cm, and 40 cm, respectively.

  abstract = {To understand the importance of plants in structuring the vertical distributions of soil nutrients, we explored nutrient distributions in the top meter of soil for more than 10,000 profiles across a range of ecological conditions. Hypothesizing that vertical nutrient distributions are dominated by plant cycling relative to leaching, weathering dissolution, and atmospheric deposition, we examined three predictions: (1) that the nutrients that are most limiting for plants would have the shallowest average distributions across ecosystems, (2) that the vertical distribution of a limiting nutrient would be shallower as the nutrient became more scarce, and (3) that along a gradient of soil types with increasing weathering-leaching intensity, limiting nutrients would be relatively more abundant due to preferential cycling by plants. Globally, the ranking of vertical distributions among nutrients was shallowest to deepest in the following order: P {$>$} K {$>$} Ca {$>$} Mg {$>$} Na = Cl = SO4. Nutrients strongly cycled by plants, such as P and K, were more concentrated in the topsoil (upper 20 cm) than were nutrients usually less limiting for plants such as Na and Cl. The topsoil concentrations of all nutrients except Na were higher in the soil profiles where the elements were more scarce. Along a gradient of weathering-leaching intensity (Aridisols to Mollisols to Ultisols), total base saturation decreased but the relative contribution of exchangeable K+ to base saturation increased. These patterns are difficult to explain without considering the upward transport of nutrients by plant uptake and cycling. Shallower distributions for P and K, together with negative associations between abundance and topsoil accumulation, support the idea that plant cycling exerts a dominant control on the vertical distribution of the most limiting elements for plants (those required in high amounts in relation to soil supply). Plant characteristics like tissue stoichiometry, biomass cycling rates, above- and belowground allocation, root distributions, and maximum rooting depth may all play an important role in shaping nutrient profiles. Such vertical patterns yield insight into the patterns and processes of nutrient cycling through time.},

  abstract = {Global models predict that the occurrence of extreme climatic events will increase in the next decades, while the depletion timeline of phosphorus and potassium reserves will strongly affect fertilization regimes. There is therefore an important concern about the future productivity and survival of crops and planted forests. The exploration of deep soil horizons by the root systems could be a crucial plant feature in order to mitigate and adapt to these global changes. Recent studies have shown that the root system of eucalypt seedlings and clones reach very deep soil layers the first years after planting. Changes of fine root behaviour with soil depth have been studied down to 17 m in Brazil using various methods: soil coring, permanent trenches equipped with minirhizotrons, in-growth cores, analyses of rhizosphere soil and root anatomy, sampling of greenhouse gases, application of isotopic tracers, monitoring of soil water contents, as well as modeling approaches. These recent studies improved our understanding of the role of very deep roots for tree water and nutrient uses. They show in particular that very small densities of deep fine roots play a key functional role in tree survival during extreme drought periods and allow taking up nutrients leached from upper soil layers. An unexpectedly low mortality of fine roots after clearcutting in stands managed in coppice contributes to limit carbon and nutrient losses before canopy closure. After a brief presentation of recent findings showing the role of deep roots in eucalypt plantations, silvicultural guidelines will be proposed to reduce mortality risks under increasing abiotic stresses. The depth of the soil should be a major criterion for the selection of future afforestation areas, weed control practices, as well as fertilization regimes (type and timing of fertilizer applications). Research avenues will be proposed to gain insight into the role of deep rooting on tree functioning in eucalypt plantations},

  abstract = {The drivers underlying the development of deep root systems, whether genetic or environmental, are poorly understood but evidence has accumulated that deep rooting could be a more widespread and important trait among plants than commonly anticipated from their share of root biomass. Even though a distinct classification of "deep roots" is missing to date, deep roots provide important functions for individual plants such as nutrient and water uptake but can also shape plant communities by hydraulic lift (HL). Subterranean fauna and microbial communities are highly influenced by resources provided in the deep rhizosphere and deep roots can influence soil pedogenesis and carbon storage.Despite recent technological advances, the study of deep roots and their rhizosphere remains inherently time-consuming, technically demanding and costly, which explains why deep roots have yet to be given the attention they deserve. While state-of-the-art technologies are promising for laboratory studies involving relatively small soil volumes, they remain of limited use for the in situ observation of deep roots. Thus, basic techniques such as destructive sampling or observations at transparent interfaces with the soil (e.g., root windows) which have been known and used for decades to observe roots near the soil surface, must be adapted to the specific requirements of deep root observation. In this review, we successively address major physical, biogeochemical and ecological functions of deep roots to emphasize the significance of deep roots and to illustrate the yet limited knowledge. In the second part we describe the main methodological options to observe and measure deep roots, providing researchers interested in the field of deep root/rhizosphere studies with a comprehensive overview. Addressed methodologies are: excavations, trenches and soil coring approaches, minirhizotrons (MR), access shafts, caves and mines, and indirect approaches such as tracer-based techniques.},

Cuttings were grown for 10 weeks in layered sediment types in five large planter boxes, each box having three separate compartments. The boxes differed in the proportion of silt, sand and stones. At 10 weeks, the roots were extracted and sorted into diameter classes ({$\geq$}2 mm; 1 {$<$} 2 mm; {$<$}1 mm) according to sediment type and depth. Root length and dry mass were measured and root length density (RLD) and root mass density (RMD) calculated. Root development of S. nigra cuttings varied with the substrate, either silt, sand or stones. Roots initiated from the entire length of the cutting in the substrate but with a concentration of initials located at the bottom and close to the bottom of the cutting. There was substantial root extension into all three substrates and at all depths. Generally, RMD was higher in the stones, influenced by having the bottom of the cuttings in stones for four of the five treatments. RMD was highest for roots {$<$}1 mm diameter. RMD of roots {$<$}1 mm diameter was least for those roots growing in sand. Whereas RLD for roots {$>$}0.5 mm diameter was highest in the sand, RLD of roots with diameter {$<$}0.5 mm was lowest in sand. Roots of S. nigra cuttings were least effective in binding sand, primarily because of low RLD of roots {$<$}0.5 mm diameter. It is surmised that sand lacks water and nutrients sufficient to sustain growth of fine roots compared with silt and even stones. RLD for roots {$>$}0.5 mm diameter was lowest in silt likely due to the greater resistance of the substrate to root penetration, or possibly the greater investment into smaller roots with absorption capability.},

We used canonical correlation analysis to cross directly the occurrenceby-species table of 4 992 individuals (d.b.h. 10 cm) belonging to 120 species with qualitative soil variables and quantitative spatial data. Firstly, the list of species occurrences was confronted to nine soil descriptors characterising a weathering sequence from the initial well-drained ferralitic cover to transformed hydromorphic soil conditions. This analysis revealed that, apart from some specialised species restricted to the swamps that experience prolonged water saturation, the most abundant species can be ordered along two intermingled gradients of tolerance limiting their niche amplitude: a main gradient of tolerance to prolonged water saturation that appears down slope during the weathering sequence; a second gradient of less importance, displaying the species intolerant of prolonged water saturation according to their tolerance to temporary confinement of the uphill transformed soil systems due to the late appearance of a perched water-table. The results support the hypothesis that at Piste de St Elie, the constraining soil conditions imposed by surface water saturation are more important determinants for tree zonation of many tree species than water shortage. Secondly, the list of species occurrences was confronted to a spatial data table built from a trend surface regression of the tree coordinates. This analysis indicated that soil drainage is the main structuring factor of the local multispecies spatial pattern. After partialling out the soil effect, the multispecies pattern revealed a broader scale of heterogeneity that we supposed to be linked to endogenous factors resulting from population dynamics. Implications of the results are then discussed in the perspective of future research on tree zonation, local diversity pattern and community structuring in tropical rainforests.},

  abstract = {Studies in global plant biogeography have almost exclusively analyzed relationships of abiotic and biotic factors with the distribution and structure of vegetation aboveground. The goal of this study was to extend such analyses to the belowground structure of vegetation by determining the biotic and abiotic factors that influence vertical root distributions in the soil, including soil, climate, and plant properties. The analysis used a database of vertical root profiles from the literature with 475 profiles from 209 geographic locations. Since most profiles were not sampled to the maximum rooting depth, several techniques were used to estimate the amount of roots at greater depths, to a maximum of 3 m in some systems. The accuracy of extrapolations was tested using a subset of deeply ({$>$}2 m) sampled or completely sampled profiles. Vertical root distributions for each profile were characterized by the interpolated 50\% and 95\% rooting depths (the depths above which 50\% or 95\% of all roots were located). General linear models incorporating plant life-form dominance, climate, and soil variables explained as much as 50\% of the variance in rooting depths for various biomes and life-forms. Annual potential evapotranspiration (PET) and precipitation together accounted for the largest proportion of the variance (12{\textendash}16\% globally and 38\% in some systems). Mean 95\% rooting depths increased with decreasing latitude from 80{\textdegree} to 30{\textdegree} but showed no clear trend in the tropics. Annual PET, annual precipitation, and length of the warm season were all positively correlated with rooting depths. Rooting depths in tropical vegetation were only weakly correlated with climatic variables but were strongly correlated with sampling depths, suggesting that even after extrapolation, sampling depths there were often insufficient to characterize root profiles. Globally, {$>$}90\% of all profiles had at least 50\% of all roots in the upper 0.3 m of the soil profile (including organic horizons) and 95\% of all roots in the upper 2 m. Deeper rooting depths were mainly found in water-limited ecosystems. Deeper 95\% rooting depths were also found for shrublands compared to grasslands, in sandy soils vs. clay or loam soils, and in systems with relatively shallow organic horizons compared with deeper organic horizons.},

  abstract = {Predicting drought responses of individual trees in tropical forests remains challenging, in part because trees experience drought differently depending on their position in spatially heterogeneous environments. Specifically, topography and the competitive environment can influence the severity of water stress experienced by individual trees, leading to individual-level variation in drought impacts. A drought in 2015 in Puerto Rico provided the opportunity to assess how drought response varies with topography and neighborhood crowding in a tropical forest. In this study, we integrated 3 years of annual census data from the El Yunque Chronosequence plots with measurements of functional traits and LiDAR-derived metrics of microsite topography. We fit hierarchical Bayesian models to examine how drought, microtopography, and neighborhood crowding influence individual tree growth and survival, and the role functional traits play in mediating species' responses to these drivers. We found that while growth was lower during the drought year, drought had no effect on survival, suggesting that these forests are fairly resilient to a single-year drought. However, growth response to drought, as well as average growth and survival, varied with topography: tree growth in valley-like microsites was more negatively affected by drought, and survival was lower on steeper slopes while growth was higher in valleys. Neighborhood crowding reduced growth and increased survival, but these effects did not vary between drought/non-drought years. Functional traits provided some insight into mechanisms by which drought and topography affected growth and survival. For example, trees with high specific leaf area grew more slowly on steeper slopes, and high wood density trees were less sensitive to drought. However, the relationships between functional traits and response to drought and topography were weak overall. Species sorting across microtopography may drive observed relationships between average performance, drought response, and topography. Our results suggest that understanding species' responses to drought requires consideration of the microenvironments in which they grow. Complex interactions between regional climate, topography, and traits underlie individual and species variation in drought response.},

We used field data and the Century ecosystem model to explore the role of soil texture in belowground C storage, nutrient pool sizes, and N fluxes in highly weathered soils in an Amazonian forest ecosystem. Our field results showed that sandy soils stored approximately 113 Mg C ha-1 to a 1-m depth versus 101 Mg C ha-1 in clay soils. Coarse root C represented a large and significant ecosystem C pool, amounting to 62\% and 48\% of the surface soil C pool on sands and clays, respectively, and 34\% and 22\% of the soil C pool on sands and clays to 1-m depth. The quantity of labile soil P, the soil C:N ratio, and live and dead fine root biomass in the 0{\textendash}10-cm soil depth decreased along a gradient from sands to clays, whereas the opposite trend was observed for total P, mineral N, potential N mineralization, and denitrification enzyme activity. The Century model was able to predict the observed trends in surface soil C and N in loams and sands but underestimated C and N pools in the sands by approximately 45\%. The model predicted that total belowground C (0{\textendash}20 cm depth) in sands would be approximately half that of the clays, in contrast to the 89\% we measured. This discrepancy is likely to be due to an underestimation of the role of belowground C allocation with low litter quality in sands, as well as an overestimation of the role of physical C protection by clays in this ecosystem. Changes in P and water availability had little effect on model outputs, whereas adding N greatly increased soil organic matter pools and productivity, illustrating the need for further integration of model structure and tropical forest biogeochemical cycling.},

  abstract = {Fine root dynamics have the potential to contribute significantly to ecosystem-scale biogeochemical cycling, including the production and emission of greenhouse gases. This is particularly true in tropical forests which are often characterized as having large fine root biomass and rapid rates of root production and decomposition. We examined patterns in fine root dynamics on two soil types in a lowland moist Amazonian forest, and determined the effect of root decay on rates of C and N trace gas fluxes. Root production averaged 229 ({$\pm$}35) and 153 ({$\pm$}27) g m-2 yr-1 for years 1 and 2 of the study, respectively, and did not vary significantly with soil texture. Root decay was sensitive to soil texture with faster rates in the clay soil (k=-0.96 year-1) than in the sandy loam soil (k=-0.61 year-1), leading to greater standing stocks of dead roots in the sandy loam. Rates of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were significantly greater in the clay soil (13{$\pm$}1 ng N cm-2 h-1) than in the sandy loam (1.4{$\pm$}0.2 ng N cm-2 h-1). Root mortality and decay following trenching doubled rates of N2O emissions in the clay and tripled them in sandy loam over a 1-year period. Trenching also increased nitric oxide fluxes, which were greater in the sandy loam than in the clay. We used trenching (clay only) and a mass balance approach to estimate the root contribution to soil respiration. In clay soil root respiration was 264{\textendash}380 g C m-2 yr-1, accounting for 24\% to 35\% of the total soil CO2 efflux. Estimates were similar using both approaches. In sandy loam, root respiration rates were slightly higher and more variable (521{$\pm$}206 g C m2 yr-1) and contributed 35\% of the total soil respiration. Our results show that soil heterotrophs strongly dominate soil respiration in this forest, regardless of soil texture. Our results also suggest that fine root mortality and decomposition associated with disturbance and land-use change can contribute significantly to increased rates of nitrogen trace gas emissions.},

  abstract = {The soil properties most likely to influence species composition in lowland tropical rain forests are, in decreasing order of importance: P availability, Al toxicity, drainage, water-holding capacity, and availability of K, Ca, and Mg. A total of 18 studies were located in which species occurrence was studied in relation to such soil properties. Several of these report clear trends with soil physical properties, mainly drainage as affected by topographic position. Only three offer evidence for correlations with soil chemical properties. In all three, the study area spanned soils of very widely differing age and thus soil fertility. Failure to find correlations with chemical properties may be due to: lack of range in soil fertility across the sites studied, failure of soil test methods to measure availability of nutrients to plants, or temporal and spatial variability in soil properties. Existing soil classification systems do not provide enough information on any particular soil to help establish relations between its chemical properties and plant distribution. Nonetheless, soils at ecological study sites must be classified if their nature and properties are to be made clear to others working worldwide. Traditional, largely subjective, soil-mapping techniques may reduce sampling needs by allowing stratification of soil and plant sampling by broad soil types. The mapping must be done, however, at a scale similar to the patchiness of the plant community (usually finer than 1:5000), something done in only 3 of the 18 studies located. Correlative studies are only the first step in understanding causal relations between soil properties and plant species distribution. Next, nutritional, drainage, and water requirements must be established for individual species. Then field experiments must be set up to establish cause and effect.},

  abstract = {We observed strong positive relationships between soil properties and forest dynamics of growth and mortality across twelve primary lowland tropical forests in a phosphorus-poor region of the Guiana Shield. Average tree growth (diameter at breast height) increased from 0.81 to 2.1\,mm\,yr-1 along a soil texture gradient from 0 to 67\% clay, and increasing metal-oxide content. Soil organic carbon stocks in the top 30\,cm ranged from 30 to 118 tons C ha-1, phosphorus content ranged from 7 to 600\,mg\,kg-1 soil, and the relative abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi ranged from 0 to 50\%, all positively correlating with soil clay, and iron and aluminum oxide and hydroxide content. In contrast, already low extractable phosphorus (Bray P) content decreased from 4.4 to {$<$}0.02\,mg\,kg-1 in soil with increasing clay content. A greater prevalence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in more clayey forests that had higher tree growth and mortality, but not biomass, indicates that despite the greater investment in nutrient uptake required, soils with higher clay content may actually serve to sustain high tree growth in tropical forests by avoiding phosphorus losses from the ecosystem. Our study demonstrates how variation in soil properties that retain carbon and nutrients can help to explain variation in tropical forest growth and mortality, but not biomass, by requiring niche specialization and contributing to biogeochemical diversification across this region.},

  abstract = {In recent decades, afforestation of agricultural land in Finland has caused a substantial change in land use. To assess the potential of such former agricultural soils for production of tree crops, information on soil properties is needed. The water-retention characteristics (WRC), bulk density (BD), organic matter (OM) concentration and particle-size distribution were studied in soil on afforested agricultural land in western Finland. Sites with an OM{$<$}40\% in the 0{\textendash}20cm soil layer were sampled. Undisturbed core samples were taken from the 5{\textendash}10, 15{\textendash}20, 25{\textendash}30 and 35{\textendash}40cm soil depths at 38 profiles on 23 sites. The results suggested that the properties of former agricultural soils differ considerably from the pristine mineral forest soils. The sites studied were characterised by high OM, fine texture, gleyic properties in the soil profile and low air-filled porosity (AFP) at field capacity (-10kPa matric potential), resulting from the predomination of small pores. AFP was, in general, less than 20\% in the topmost soil layer and decreased markedly with increasing soil depth indicating deteriorating aeration. In mineral soils (OM{$<$}15\% in the 0{\textendash}20cm soil depth) with a median particle size of {$<$}0.02mm (clayey and silty soils) AFP was significantly lower than in the coarser-textured soils. In mull soils (OM 15{\textendash}40\% in the 0{\textendash}20cm soil depth), texture did not affect AFP. Prediction of AFP from OM was not successful because OM controlled both the upper and lower limits of AFP to a similar degree. The results indicate that high water-table level associated with the predomination of fine pores in the soil leads to potential risk of restricted aeration and reduced forest growth.},
