#### 1. ROOTS MATTER
![[Pasted image 20231217230458.png]]
*Fig1 adapted from Freshet et al. 2021*
Roots are essential for the nutrition and water uptake of trees. It is a complexe subject of research, with a lot of different trait associated. They are difficult to measure compared with aboveground tree part traits, so root traits studies are few compared with studies on other tree traits.

On this figure you can see all the different trait categories related to root study.  

Those traits are modulated by biotic and abiotic factors, of which soil texture, topography and drainage type play a big part.

#### ACRISOLS: the DRAINAGE BARRIER
![[Pasted image 20231217223727.png]]
*Drainage type and drainage barrier effect on root*
Drainage type is on of the main factors influencing forest community structure, according to PÃ©lissier et al., 2002; Sabatier et al., 1997). 
Here you can see the two main type of drainage associated with acrisol.
â†ª as you can see, there is a important variation of the thickness and the depth of the silty horizon with de type of drainage
- DVD has more that one meter of soil before reaching the drainage barrier, then a great water reserve
- SLD has a thinner soil with poor water reserve

#### ACRISOL EFFECT ON ROOT DISTRIBUTION
![[Pasted image 20231217223654.png]]
Focusing on SLD, this type of drainage is particularly restricting for trees.
â†ª poor water reserve of SLD induces a **hydric stress** during the dry season
â†ª SLD induces **temporary water table** during the wet season, which create an anoxic environment for roots
â†ª RVD is expected to be stop by the change rapid change of texture induced by the drainage barrier (Humbel, 1976; Ferry 2003) 

With our study, we tried to adresse drainage barrier restriction on roots

#### OUR STUDY
![[Pasted image 20231217234928.png]]
Therefore, we have studied whether a drainage barrier restricts tree roots on slopes in Paracou, and whether is plays a role in shaping forest community structure. 

We investigated the effect of the depth, at which the drainage barrier occurs, on root vertical distribution and on 3 different forest structure indicators, which are DBH, species richness and tree density. 

Our first hypothesis is that root density is negatively influenced by the drainage barrier.

Our second hypothesis is that the depth at which the drainage barrier appears can be a predictor of DBH, species richness and tree density.

Both H1 and H2 has been studied separately. We're going to start start presenting you H1 study, from material and method to the result, then we'll do the same with H2, before a general conclusion.

#### STUDY SITE : PARACOU CONTEXT
ðŸ’¡==*since the "study site" is the only common part of mat and met, I think we can present it right after the introduction, and not saying more about paracou in the introduction ?*==
Our study takes place at Paracou research station in French Guiana.

> **Epron et al. (2006)** confirmed the presence of SLD in this area. They found that the depth of the drainage barrier on slopes depends on the topographical position, with deeper barriers at higher elevation. However, the specific ways in which drainage barriers influence both roots and forest structure remain understudied.
